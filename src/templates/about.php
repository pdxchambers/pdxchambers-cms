        <p>
            My journey into Software Engineering has been an exciting adventure. After serving in the Navy, I initially set out to pursue an 
            English degree. However, a basic Computer Science class during my freshman year introduced me to HTML and sparked a new passion. 
            I decided to switch my major to Computer Science and later graduated with a Bachelor of Science.

            My career began in I.T., primarily in the healthcare industry, where I was responsible for upgrading workstations across hospitals 
            and clinics in the Portland Metro and Vancouver, Washington areas. While this work was rewarding, my interest in web development 
            continued to grow.

            I started exploring web development as a hobby, focusing on WordPress. I spent several years experimenting with templates 
            and plugins, taking on projects for friends and family along the way. By late 2016, I realized it was time to pursue programming 
            more seriously and began searching for entry-level roles. In December 2017, I joined Dealer Spike as a Support Agent.

            Dealer Spike has been a fantastic environment for professional growth. Within my first year, I was working with VIP clients and
            maintaining the corporate website. Two years later, I transitioned to the Development team as a Software Engineer and eventually 
            advanced to Software Engineer II. My role has involved maintaining Dealer Spike's legacy platform using technologies such as 
            Classic ASP, JavaScript, SQL Server, .NET, C#, and React. We work within an Agile framework and leverage tools like Jira for 
            project management, Git and Bitbucket for version control, Jenkins for CI/CD, and Octopus for deployment.

            Reflecting on my career, I feel incredibly fortunate. It has been a challenging yet fulfilling journey that has allowed me to 
            collaborate with talented professionals and gain valuable experience. I've learned so much about programming and about myself, 
            and I'm excited to continue embracing new challenges and opportunities in the future.
