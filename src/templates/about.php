        <p>
            My journey into Software Engineering has been quite the adventure. After my time in the Navy, I initially set out to earn an English degree, 
            but a basic Computer Science class in my freshman year introduced me to HTML and ignited a new passion. I switched my major to Computer Science 
            and graduated with a Bachelor of Science.

            My career began in I.T., primarily within the healthcare industry, where I played a key role in upgrading workstations in hospitals and clinics 
            around the Portland Metro area and Vancouver, Washington. This experience was rewarding, but my interest in web development continued to grow.

            In 2009, I started exploring web development as a hobby, focusing on WordPress. I spent years tinkering with templates and plugins, and took on 
            several projects for friends and family. By late 2016, I realized it was time for a change and began seeking entry-level programming roles. In 
            December 2017, I joined Dealer Spike as a Support Agent.

            Dealer Spike has been a fantastic place for my growth. Within a year, I was working with VIP clients and maintaining the corporate website. Two 
            years later, I transitioned to the Development team as a Software Engineer and eventually advanced to Software Engineer II. I've been responsible 
            for enhancing Dealer Spike's legacy platform, working with technologies like Classic ASP, JavaScript, SQL Server, .NET, C#, and React. Our team 
            operates under Agile methodology, using tools such as Jira for project management, Git and Bitbucket for version control, Jenkins for CI/CD, and 
            Octopus for deployment.

            Reflecting on my career, I feel incredibly fortunate. It has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to work with amazing people and gain 
            invaluable experience. I've learned a great deal, not just about programming, but also about myself. I'm excited about the future and looking forward 
            to new challenges and opportunities ahead.
